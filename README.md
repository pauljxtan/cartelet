# Cartelet

An Elixir library for numerical computing, with a focus on higher-level procedures like ODE/PDE integration and stochastic optimization.

## Roadmap

- Derivatives
  - Methods:
    - [x] Finite difference (forward, backward, central)
- ODE integration
  - Methods:
    - [x] RK4
    - [ ] Adaptive RK4
  - Systems:
    - [x] Lorenz attractor
    - [ ] ...

## Why?

For fun and learning, but stuff should still be usable if you're interested in numerical computing with Elixir and performance isn't a big concern.

I've also suspected for a while now that functional languages may be particularly well-suited for this sort of thing--time to find out!
