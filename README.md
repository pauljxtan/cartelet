# Cartelet

An Elixir library for numerical and scientific computing, with a focus on higher-level procedures like ODE/PDE integration and stochastic optimization.

## Roadmap

* Integrals
  * [x] Trapedoizal rules
  * [x] Simpson's rules
  * ...
* Derivatives
  * Methods:
    * [x] Finite difference (forward, backward, central)
* ODE integration
  * Methods:
    * [x] RK4
    * [ ] Adaptive RK4
  * Systems:
    * [x] Lorenz attractor
    * [ ] ...

TODO: Accompanying LaTeX document with all relevant formulae

## Why

* Numerical computing and functional programming are fun
* Having a code-based reference for numerical methods and concepts
